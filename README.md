## Installation

To get started with the SK Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/byte-dev03/sk-monitoring-system.git
   cd sk-monitoring-system
   ```

2. ***Run the live server:**
    Once inside the repository, to open the project in a web browser, you must first need to start a server using `live-server` or any other ways to start a server, but with live-server, you must run this to continue:
    ```bash
    live-server --port=3000
    ```

    Then `live-server` would automatically open the website in a browser.

4. **Open the application in your browser:**

   After starting the vite server ***and*** the backend server, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to view the application.
